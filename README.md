# Traffic Surveillance System

# Concept
    - This project aims to develop an advanced traffic monitoring system using Edge AI for real-time local processing and Cloud AI for efficient remote operations. It addresses the issue of delayed responses in current systems, aiming to enhance traffic safety and management. The system includes an Edge Device for detecting cars, measuring speed, counting cars, and reading plate numbers, and a Main Platform featuring a dashboard, live video, maps, and data analysis tools. A Web Form allows users to report traffic issues.
